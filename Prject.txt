Project 1: Real-Time Call Center Performance Analytics Platform

Business Problem Addressed — Project 1

The telecom BPO was managing multiple client call queues, each with different SLAs, call volumes, agent teams, and performance expectations. However, they lacked real-time visibility into call center operations. Reporting was mostly:
Manual (Excel reports at the end of the day)
Delayed (data available hours or next day)
Reactive (issues discovered after SLA breaches)
Not standardized across clients
Because of this, the operations team and client leads could not:

Context:
A telecom BPO had 30+ enterprise clients, each with separate inbound/outbound call queues. Leadership needed real-time visibility into call volume, agent performance, and SLA adherence.
My Role: Lead Backend & Analytics Engineer
Tech Stack:
Kafka, Kafka Streams, Python, TimescaleDB/PostgreSQL, Grafana, Prometheus, Kubernetes

What I Built:
Integrated live call events from the telecom switch (SIP/CTI feeds) into Kafka topics
Designed a multi-tenant data model to isolate metrics per client
Implemented stream processors to compute real-time KPIs:
Call queue wait time
Agent occupancy
SLA compliance % (Answered < X secs)
First call resolution rates
Stored time-series metrics in TimescaleDB for analytics queries
Built Grafana Dashboards for:
Operations supervisors (live queue & agent load)
Client managers (daily performance & SLA trends)
C-suite leadership (KPI scorecards)
Configured Alerting (Slack + email) for:
SLA drops
High call abandonment
Understaffing
Impact:
Reduced SLA violations by 22% within 3 months

Eliminated manual Excel reporting → saving 4–6 hours/day

Leadership gained real-time operational visibility, not next-day reports.
