Day-to-Day Responsibilities (Spoken Answer)

On a day-to-day basis, my work typically involves a mix of pipeline development, data modeling, dashboard enhancements, and system monitoring:
Pipeline Monitoring & Reliability
I start my day checking Kafka consumer lag, ingestion throughput, and TimescaleDB performance dashboards.
I review alerts from Prometheus / Alertmanager to ensure there are no delays or drops in data.
If there are any issues, I analyze logs and metrics, identify bottlenecks, and optimize the consumers or storage layer.
Data Modeling & Stream Processing Enhancements
I work on improving data transformation logic in Kafka Consumers or Stream processors.

This includes handling new events, evolving schema versions, cleaning or enriching raw events, and maintaining backward compatibility.
Database Optimization
I review performance of TimescaleDB hypertables, compression policies, retention policies, and indexing strategies.
I ensure queries behind Grafana dashboards are fast and cost-efficient.
Dashboard Development & KPI Alignment
I collaborate with business teams (Operations, Product, Leadership) to understand what insights they need next.
Then I convert those needs into:
Metrics
Aggregations
Visualizations
Alerts

I update or build new dashboards in Grafana and validate them with stakeholders.
Data Quality & Validation
I define data validation rules, reconciliation checks, and monitoring to ensure accuracy and consistency.
I regularly test whether the data pipeline aligns with business definitions of metrics.
Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
I maintain architecture diagrams, data lineage documentation, and dashboard usage notes.
I often share updates with the engineering team or leadership on analytical insights or pipeline improvements.

Continuous Improvement

I explore ways to improve latency, reliability, and scalability, such as batching logic, async processing, compression strategies, or horizontal scaling.
If needed, I prototype tools or evaluate enhancements such as Flink/Spark/Materialized Views.
Short One-Liner Summary (For HR or Senior Leadership Rounds)

I manage the full real-time analytics pipeline — ensuring data flows reliably through Kafka, is transformed correctly, stored efficiently in TimescaleDB, and visualized clearly in Grafana for decision-making.

If interviewer asks: “Who do you interact with daily?”
Engineering Team → For pipeline development & versioning
Product Managers → To align dashboards with business KPIs
Operations / Business Users → To validate insights and add new metrics
DevOps / Infra → For scaling and monitoring SLAs
